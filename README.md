# TR-9
Open digital mobile radio, compatible with M17 standard. Uses Codec2 vocoder and tiny-AES-c for optional OTA encryption. Designed for STM32F777 microcontroller. RFM26W module was used as a complete transceiver.

This is a complete SW4STM32 project for the TR-9 board.

# TODO:
- Fix PCB error - there's no GND connection to the SD card  
- Swap SPI1 and SPI2  
- Replace SD slot with a different type
