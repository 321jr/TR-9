# TR-9
**This repo contains the TR-9 Proof of Concept only! I don't recommend building it, because the Physical Layer (and M17 standard) has changed!** We are working on the new release, please standby.

# Old description  
Open-source digital mobile radio, compatible with M17 standard. Uses Codec2 vocoder and internal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) hardware for optional OTA encryption. Designed for STM32F777 microcontroller. ~~Si4463-C2 chip is used as a complete transceiver.~~ There is a possibility of using other block ciphers like ChaCha.

This is a complete SW4STM32 project for the TR-9 board.
